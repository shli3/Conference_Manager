    <h3 class="heading6">Frequestly Asked Questions</h3>
                 <ul>
                 	<li>What forms of payment are accepted?</li>
                 	<p>Credit card [Visa, Mastercard, Amex], wire transfer, and check payment are all accepted. To pay by wire transfer or check payment, fill out the registration form and select your preferred method of payment on the Payment page.</p>
                 	<li>What are the steps for wire transfer?</li>
                 	<p><b>Step 1</b>: Complete registration, select wire transfer as the payment method.<br>
                       <b>Step 2</b>: Complete wire transfer. (Please contact <b>cikm2019regist@gmail.com</b> for bank info and other questions)<br>
                       <b>Step 3</b>: Send your confirmation of the transfer to <b>cikm2019regist@gmail.com</b>. <b>Note that, your registration will not be valid until we receive your confirmation of payment.</b></p>
                 	<li>What are the steps for check payment?</li>
                 	<p><b>Step 1</b>: Complete registration, select check as the payment method.<br>
                       <b>Step 2</b>: Send your name, confirmation number, check number to <b>cikm2019regist@gmail.com</b>.</p>
                 	<li>Can I receive an invoice for my registration?</li>
                 	<p><b>Yes</b>. Your confirmation email will have a link to your invoice.</p>
                 	<li>I cannot participate at the conference and I already paid my registration fee. Can I transfer my registration to a colleague who will attend?</li>
                 	<p><b>No</b>. Registration is not transferable. You have to cancel your registration before the late registration deadline and your colleagues must register themselves.</p>
                 	<li>I have more than one accepted main conference paper. Do I need to pay registration fee for each one?</li>
                 	<p><b>Yes</b>. At least one author of each accepted paper must register at a full conference registration rate (as an ACM or non-ACM member) and one full conference registration can NOT represent more than one papers.</p>
                 	<li>Iâ€™m a student, which type of registration should I choose?</li>
                 	<p><b>If you are the only author to be registered at the conference</b>, a full registration as a student is not acceptable for this case. You must register as a full conference registration (as an ACM or non-ACM member). That is to say: In this case, you can only register full conference as an ACM Member ($850) or as a non-ACM Member ($950).<br>
                    <b>If one of the other authors has registered as a full conference registration (as an ACM or non-ACM member)</b>, or you are not an author of any accepted paper of CIKM 2019, you can register as a student via Non-member Registration -> Student -> Full Conference Registration ($600) in the registration website.
                    <br>
                     (The prices we illustrate are Early Birds rates for full conference registrations.)</p>
                 	<li>I want to register the AnalytiCup Finals only. How can I do that?</li>
                 	<p>Through the registration system. Choose Non-Member Registration in the summary page then select AnalytiCup Registration (Guest) as your registration type.</p>
                 	<li>Do I need to buy an AnalytiCup Finals Ticket with full conference registration?</li>
                 	<P><b>No</b>. However, due to the hard-coding of the registration system, the AnalytiCup Finals Ticket is still visible as an optional item during full conference registration. Attendees with full conference registration shall not choose it (since it is covered in the full conference registration fee), just click "next" to continue.</P>
                 	<li>My institution requires me to provide a VAT number of the organization that is receiving the payment. Whatâ€™s the VAT number of ACM?</li>
                 	<p>As a US-based organization, ACM does not have a VAT number. The federal tax ID number of ACM is: <b>13-1921358</b>
                 	</p>
                 </ul>
